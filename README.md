Controlling myTIER eScooters with an ESP32

This project was sparked from this thread: https://mytier-forum.de/community/topic/akkustand-via-bluetooth-auslesen/
It was discovered that the myTIER Scooters accept arbitrary Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connections and can be controlled when in possesion of the correct BT-Password. 

The Project allows to:
- Access to Information/Stats of the Scooter
- lock/unlock
- turn LED on/Off
